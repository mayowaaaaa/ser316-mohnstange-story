Story
One day I was driving my BMW while wearing my Lederhose, when I saw a perfectly good bratwurst sitting in the middle of the road.
I was in a hurry though, and with my Flughafen broken, I knew I couldn't rescue that perfecly good bratwurst without being late and smelly at my destination.
Before I could figure out a way to save the bratwurst on the Hauptstrasse, as I drove by it my Hund jumped out of the BMW and grabbed the bratwurst.
At this point, I knew the bratwurst was no good, and that made me really sad, but luckily I had an emergency supply of Brot and Gebaeck in the trunk of my BMW.
Once I got back into my BMW and started driving, I saw a Mehlhase driving a Porsche and eating an apfelkuchen in the lane next to me. 
At this point I remembered the room full of gebaeck in my 2nd Schloss, and I turned around and drove straight there.
It would be a long drive to my Schloss in Berlin, but so be it, the disappointment would drive me, as my hund was peacefully eating that perfect bratwurst in the backseat.
Once I reached my 2nd Schloss, however, I discovered that the Mehlhase driving the Porsche had crashed into my biergarten.
The mehlhase was planning to crash into my 1st biergarten at my other Schloss, but I was able to stop them with a DÃ¶ner I threw at their wheels.
After a long and tiring day, I ate an entire box of gebaeck and went to sleep. 
I must have had one too many gabaecks and ended sleeping next to the toilette all night long, wishing I never bought the whole dozen gabaecks.
Weirdly though, in my dream, I was at a Flughafen and was racing with a wettbewerbsfaehig business man to get in line first.
